I want to develop a case for the Raspberry Pi 4 that include Internal Battery, All IOs on one side, access to GPIO, Cooling system for overclocking, power button and eventually OLED Display.

I'm looking for someone that want to collaborate in this project. I would like to get in touch with you if you are interested. :)
