<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Develoop and Build an affordable and open source case for the Raspberry Pi 4 to help the users to become more productive then ever.
<img src="./ressources/images/top.png" alt="top_view">

### Starting Situation

Surfing on the net I discovered some very cool case solutions for the RPi4. I almost ordered one of those products (Argon One). But then I realized that when the RPi4 was powered by a Power Bank(almost always in my case)(5V@2.1A) the CPU had some serious throttling problems. So overclocking with this power supply was out of discussion. I searched for alternative battery powered power supply(5.2V@3A). Without success.
At the same time I discovered some interesting Half-solutions:
* [Argon One](https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-raspberry-pi-4-case.html) (very nice design, power button, cooling system)
* [Acrylic Raspberry Pi set-top box kit](https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php/Acrylic_Raspberry_Pi_set-top_box_kit_SKU:_ZP-0098) (all IOs on the back, full dual HDMI)
* [Raspberry Pi RGB Cooling HAT](https://www.yahboom.net/study/RGB_Cooling_HAT) (OLED dipslay with IP address, CPU temp, etc)
* [Adafruit PowerBoost 1000 Charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465) (UPS solution with Li-Ion cell, power supply)

So I decided to take inspiration from all this product and make my own solution! :)

### Aim
Develop and Build an affordable, open source, smart and good looking case for the Raspberry Pi 4.
Make good documentation and a building guide available to everyone so that anyone can build ther own case at home.
Find someone on github to collaborate with (I'm new on the platform).

### Product Reqirements
* Size: max double the footprint of the RPi4. Max height not defined.
* Battery: min 2 hours of battery life.
* Cooling System: capable of cooling Overclocked RPi4.
* Power Button: capable of Soft and Hard Shutdown.
* PSU: UPS, BMS and 5.2V@min 2A output supply.
* Accessible GPIOs
